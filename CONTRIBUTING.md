## Suggesting Features

### Before Suggesting

1. **Check existing issues** - It might already be proposed
2. **Check documentation** - Feature might already exist
3. **Consider alternatives** - Are there workarounds?

### Creating a Feature Request

**Include:**

1. **Clear Title** - Describe the feature briefly
2. **Problem Statement** - What problem does this solve?
3. **Proposed Solution** - How should it work?
4. **Alternatives** - Other ways to solve the problem
5. **Use Cases** - When would this be useful?
6. **Examples** - How would users interact with it?

**Example:**

```markdown
## Feature: Edit schedules without recreating

**Problem:**
Currently, to modify a schedule, users must:
1. Cancel the existing schedule
2. Create a new one
3. Re-enter all labels

This is time-consuming and prone to errors.

**Proposed Solution:**
Add `/schedule edit id:schedule-id` command that:
- Opens wizard pre-filled with current values
- Allows editing specific labels
- Updates schedule without deletion

**Use Cases:**
- Fixing typos in event labels
- Adjusting timing (bloc, start_time)
- Adding/removing labels from cycle

**Example Usage:**
```
/schedule edit id:abc123
```
Then modify values in wizard.
```

## Contributing Documentation

### Types of Documentation

1. **User Documentation** - How to use features
2. **Developer Documentation** - How to contribute
3. **API Documentation** - Code comments and types
4. **README** - Project overview

### Documentation Guidelines

**Writing Style:**

- Write in clear, simple English
- Use active voice
- Be concise but complete
- Include examples
- Use proper formatting

**Structure:**

- Use headings and subheadings
- Include table of contents for long documents
- Add links between related documents
- Use lists for multiple items
- Include code blocks for commands

**Examples:**

Always include examples:
```markdown
## Good Example:

Use `/schedule create` to create a new schedule:

```
/schedule create count:3 bloc:1w start_time:20:00 len:2h location_elsewhere:Online
```

This creates a weekly schedule with 3 rotating event labels.
```

**Testing Documentation:**

## Style Guidelines

### Code Style

**TypeScript:**

- Follow existing code style
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Use TypeScript types properly
- Follow the project's linting rules

**Example:**

```typescript
// Good
async function createSchedule(options: ScheduleOptions): Promise<Schedule> {
  // Validate options
  if (!options.count || options.count < 1) {
    throw new Error("Count must be at least 1");
  }
  
  // Create schedule
  const schedule = await Schedule.create(options);
  return schedule;
}

// Avoid
async function cs(o: any): Promise<any> {
  if (!o.c || o.c < 1) throw new Error("Count must be at least 1");
  const s = await Schedule.create(o);
  return s;
}
```

### Commit Messages

**Format:**

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Types:**
- `feat` - New feature
- `fix` - Bug fix
- `docs` - Documentation
- `style` - Formatting, no code change
- `refactor` - Code restructuring
- `test` - Adding tests
- `chore` - Maintenance

**Examples:**

```
feat(schedule): add edit command

Implements schedule editing functionality allowing users to modify
existing schedules without recreation.

Closes #123
```

```
fix(wizard): prevent duplicate label submission

Fixed issue where clicking submit multiple times created duplicate
labels in the schedule.

Fixes #456
```

### Documentation Style

**Markdown:**

- Use proper heading levels (`#`, `##`, `###`)
- Include blank lines around code blocks
- Use backticks for inline code
- Use triple backticks for code blocks
- Include language identifier in code blocks

**Example:**

````markdown
## Good

To create a schedule, use:

```javascript
/schedule create count:3 bloc:1w
```

This creates a schedule with 3 labels.

## Avoid

To create a schedule, use:
`/schedule create count:3 bloc:1w`
This creates a schedule with 3 labels.
